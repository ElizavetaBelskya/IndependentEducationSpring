                It can be very difficult to find a tutor. As a rule, people do not seek to find professionals who are able to meet all their needs.
                In most cases, they want the teacher to be easy to communicate, know his subject well and not require too much money.
                But, unfortunately, this is not the case at all.
                Even the simplest math tutor, who has nothing to do with professional education, is able to give an excellent result.
                The tutor must be competent, knowledgeable, loving his job.

                We offer students and tutors free pricing, teachers do not pay commissions and have no obligations

                You may not have the experience, but you may have the talent to teach other people.
                Being a teacher is, first of all, a great love for children and a willingness to give them all your knowledge and strength.
                A teacher should always be ready to discover new, unknown things.
